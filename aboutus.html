    <h2>About the University</h2>
    <h3>History</h3>
    <p>Inspired by the vision of Dr. John Lim and his wife, Dr. Maria Lim, who believed in the transformative power of education, Lim Campus was founded on January 15, 2025. The campus is situated in a picturesque 8-hectare area, providing a serene environment conducive to learning and growth.</p>
    <p>The initial campus building was established with a modest enrollment of 500 students, offering programs in Business Administration and Information Technology. Over the years, Lim Campus has expanded its academic offerings, faculty, research initiatives, community service, infrastructure, and professional development programs. This growth has been driven by a commitment to excellence and a desire to meet the evolving needs of students and the community.</p>
    <p>In 2028, Lim Campus achieved a significant milestone by receiving accreditation from the Commission on Higher Education (CHED), recognizing its high standards in education and administration.</p>
    <p>Today, Lim Campus continues to strive for excellence in education, fostering a culture of innovation and continuous improvement. It has established a robust network of national and international partnerships in higher education and industry.</p>
    <p>Lim Campus remains dedicated to its founding philosophy that education is the cornerstone of national development and transformation. It upholds the ideals of teaching, community service, and research, with the guiding principle that "Education is the Key to Progress."</p>
